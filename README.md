# Semester Project 2 – Auction Website

##  Project Description

This project is a part of the final delivery for the third semester at Noroff Front-End Development. The goal is to build a fully functional **auction website** using all the skills we've learned throughout the studies.

The website allows users to create auctions, bid on others' listings, and manage their own profile. The application is built with a **modular file structure**, uses **SASS** for styling, and **Bootstrap 5** for responsive layout. Functionality such as **login**, **register**, **listing management**, **search**, and **user bidding history** are all included.

##  Goal

> To create a modern auction website where users can register, log in, list items for auction, and place bids on other users’ items.
